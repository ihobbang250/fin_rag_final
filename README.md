# Finance-RAG-Challenge

This repository contains code and data for the Finance-RAG-Challenge, a project focused on enhancing retrieval techniques for financial data tasks. The process involves multiple steps, including retrieval, hybrid search, and reranking, with evaluations on validation datasets. For more details, refer to `report.pdf`.

## Repository Structure

- **final/**: Contains result files intended for final submission.
- **eval/**: Holds evaluation datasets for validation purposes.
- **data/**: Stores data related to each task, including corpus and query files.
- **.ipynb**: Jupyter notebooks used to generate results for each task.

## Workflow

The overall process for this project follows three main steps:

1. **Retrieval**: Initial retrieval of relevant documents based on each task's queries.
2. **Hybrid Search**: Combines both sparse and dense retrieval methods to enhance relevance.
3. **Rerank**: Final reranking of retrieved results to maximize accuracy.
